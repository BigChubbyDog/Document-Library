- **No MCP needed** - already has full capabilities
- **More powerful** - can execute complex multi-step tasks
- **Integrated development environment** for coding

## Your BigChubbyDog MCP Server

The custom MCP server provides these tools to Claude Desktop:
- `list_working_dirs` - List configured directories
- `read_file` - Read files from system
- `run_powershell` - Execute PowerShell commands
- `azure_cli` - Run Azure CLI commands
- `git_status` - Check repository status
- `list_azure_resources` - List Azure resources
- `get_system_info` - Get system information
- `search_files` - Search for files

## How to Use

### In Claude Desktop
1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new configuration
2. You can now ask Claude Desktop to:
   - "List my Azure resources"
   - "Check git status of my repos"
   - "Run PowerShell commands"
   - "Search for files in my directories"

### In Claude Code (This Interface)
You already have all these capabilities and more! For example:
- Use `Bash` tool for any command execution
- Use `Read/Write` tools for file operations
- Use `Task` tool for complex multi-step operations
- Direct access to your entire system

## Testing the Integration

### Test in Claude Desktop:
After restarting, try: "Can you list my working directories using the BigChubbyDog MCP server?"

### Test in Claude Code:
You're already using it! Every command I run uses these built-in tools.

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude Desktop doesn't recognize the MCP server:
1. Ensure Claude Desktop is fully closed
2. Check the config file at: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Restart Claude Desktop
4. Check for errors in the Claude Desktop console (if available)

### If commands fail in Claude Desktop:
- The MCP server logs to console when run manually
- Test manually: `py -3.13 -m bigchubbydog_mcp.server`
- Check Python path is correct
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: Both Claude Desktop and Claude Code now have:
- File system access
- Command execution capabilities
- Azure resource access
- Git repository access

Only use in trusted environments.
