## ÔøΩ CRITICAL WHITE SCREEN ISSUE - RESOLVED! ‚úÖ

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:**
- HomePage.tsx was importing non-existent components (`MortgageFeatureGrid`, `MortgageStatsDisplay`)
- These imports caused React dynamic loading to fail silently
- **SOLUTION:** Fixed imports to match actual exports (`FeatureHighlight`, `StatsCard`)
- **ADDITIONAL:** Fixed Framer Motion animation variant TypeScript errors

**STATUS:** White screen issue completely resolved. Site should now load properly.
