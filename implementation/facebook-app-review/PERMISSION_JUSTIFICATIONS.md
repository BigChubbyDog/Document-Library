## ðŸŽ¯ **COPY-PASTE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR FACEBOOK**

### **1. leads_retrieval**

**How Our App Uses This Permission:**

Our licensed mortgage broker platform uses leads_retrieval to capture and process mortgage inquiries submitted through Facebook lead forms. When potential customers complete lead forms advertising our mortgage services, this permission allows us to:

- Maintain compliant records of all customer inquiries as required by NMLS regulations

**Value Added for Users:**
