## ðŸ”¥ QUICK WIN HACKS

### 1. The 9 PM Advantage
When a lead comes in after 5 PM, respond immediately.
Nobody else will. You win by default.

### 2. The Saturday Pre-Approval
"Touring homes tomorrow? I'll write your pre-approval letter tonight."
Realtors LOVE this. Instant referrals.

### 3. The Weather Play
Rainy day = 30% more searches
Increase bids when it rains
Lower competition, higher quality

### 4. The Competitor Hijack
Run ads on these searches:
- "Rocket Mortgage reviews"
- "Better.com problems"
- "Quicken loans slow"

### 5. The Local Touch
Every email/text mentions a local place:
"Let's meet at Summer Moon Coffee"
"I live in Round Rock too"
"Just drove by Mueller"
